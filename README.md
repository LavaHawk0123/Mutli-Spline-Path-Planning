# Mutli-Spline-Path-Planning
This repository contains all the attempts to develop a geometric path planning algorithm that can generate multi-curved paths using Bezier and Catmull-Rom splines as well as an attempt to develop a geometric controller for following the path generated

## Examples of Paths generated :
